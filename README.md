## About This Project
- FoodieDelight is a food delivery application, as a part of this application, I have build a functionality that manage different restaurant and their menus.
- For Frontend i have use React to develop the application, for styling i have use tailwindCSS along with normal css for easy styling. 
- ForBackend i have use NodeJS, Express to develop the application, for database I have use mongoDB for easy storing data. I have also use typescript as javascript has dynamic variable, which can give error during runtime. For Validating request body in API i have use `joi` validation.
- For Database I have use mongoDB Atlas, whihc is fully-managed cloud database that handles all the complexity of deploying, managing, and healing your deployments on the cloud service.
- To indentify the error on production I have use `bunyan` logger
